# Redflood

## Introduction

Redflood is a time-series database implemented on top of Cassandra and Google Storage.

It's design is similar to [Blueflood](https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood)'s. However, Blueflood has 40k lines of Java code written in a TODO-Driven Development model. On the other hand, Redflood will have at most 4k lines of Python code, and... will support more features.
